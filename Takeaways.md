Lesson 4
Adding the prisma seed command in package.json

- Since the file is written in Typescript, you need to run it through a typescript executor such as ts-node
- ensures Prisma calls your file, compiles it and uses Prisma Client to seed the data
- The seed script needs to establish a connection to your database so it can perform create, update, or delete operations. - Prisma Client is the tool that handles this connection and provides type-safe queries for your schema.

Seeding Workflow
First download a typescript executor using npm i -D ts-node
When you run npx prisma db seed, Prisma looks up your package.json to find the "prisma": { "seed": "..." } script.
It executes that script, which in turn imports the Prisma Client and inserts your member data into the database.
Without importing and instantiating the Prisma Client in your seed file, youâ€™d have no way of persisting that data.
